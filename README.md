PPIPP: an online protein-protein interaction network prediction and analysis platform

This is the source code of protein-protein interaction prediction algorithm and online platform mentioned in my Master thesis.\
My colleague Fen Wang re-organized some analysis and published the algorithm and her results as [research artical](http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJDMB.2016.075819)

Due to I did not find a web server to host this online service, I could not provide online service anymore.
